üíª I'm a 21 year old computer science student and future Data Scientist! üßë‚Äçüíª

My projects include a wide array of technologies, such as  
  - Javascript/Typescript with React Technology and the entire Front-End Stack (HTML, CSS, SASS, Libraries etc.) 
  - C++ and other C-family languages including C# for the .NET platform and C for the low level programming
  - Python but mostly for the Data Science jobs and as a scripting device
  
 I have taught programming to people since 2021 and have worked in places including Front-End and 
 Graphics Processing since 2022 as Internships utilizing technologies such as React and C++.
 
 Apart from that I am interested in scientific fields such as Social Sciences (Postmodern Sociology and Behavioral Economy),
 Philosophy (mostly Informal Logic and Classical Aesthetics).
 
 I would like to study Applied Mathematics in the nearest future, so I can be a better programmer and gain some knowledge from social fields.
