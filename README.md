üíª I'm a 21 year old computer science student and aspiring IT generalist! üßë‚Äçüíª

My projects include a wide array of technologies, such as  
  - Javascript/Typescript with React Technology and the entire Front-End Stack (HTML, CSS, SASS, Libraries etc.) 
  - C++ and other C-family languages including C# for the .NET platform and C for the low level programming
  - Python but mostly for the Data Science jobs and as a scripting device
  
I have taught programming to people since 2021 and have worked in places including Front-End and 
Graphics Processing since 2022 as Internships utilizing technologies such as React and C++.

Apart from that I am interested in scientific fields such as Social Sciences (Postmodern Sociology and Behavioral Economy),
Philosophy (mostly Informal Logic, Classical Aesthetics and Poststructuralism).
 
I would like to study Applied Mathematics and Philosophy in the nearest future, so I can be a better programmer and gain some knowledge from social fields.
